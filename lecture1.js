// Variable , Constent and comments
// console.log("Hello coders")

/* 
  Variable ==> Variable are the container that stores that stores the different types of the value 
*/

// var age = 23;
// var age = 34;   This is bad practice and we should not reassign the variable 
// console.log(age)

// That is the reason we use the let variable 
// let age = 23;
// let age = 234  As it shows we cannot redeclare the variable but we can the change the value 

// const height = 5.5

// Datatype
